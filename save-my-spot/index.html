<h1>The Way of the Program<a class="headerlink" href="#the-way-of-the-program" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The goal of this book is to teach you to think like a computer scientist. This way of thinking combines some of the best features of mathematics, engineering, and natural science. Like mathematicians, computer scientists use formal languages to denote ideas (specifically computations). Like engineers, they design things, assembling components into systems and evaluating tradeoffs among alternatives. Like scientists, they observe the behavior of complex systems, form hypotheses, and test predictions.</p>
<p>The single most important skill for a computer scientist is <strong>problem solving</strong>. Problem solving means the ability to formulate problems, think creatively about solutions, and express a solution clearly and accurately. As it turns out, the process of learning to program is an excellent opportunity to practice problem solving skills. That’s why this chapter is called, <em>The Way of the Program</em>.</p>
<p>On one level, you will be learning to program, a useful skill by itself. On another level, you will use programming as a means to an end. As we go along, that end will become clearer.</p>
<span class="target" id="index-0"></span><div class="section" id="algorithms">
<span id="index-1"></span><h2>Algorithms<a class="headerlink" href="#algorithms" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Since problem solving is a central part of computer science, the solutions that you create through the problem solving process are also important. In computer science, we refer to these solutions as <strong>algorithms</strong>.  An algorithm is a step by step list of instructions that if followed exactly will solve the problem under consideration.</p>
<p>One of the characteristics of algorithms is that they do not require any intelligence to carry out (i.e., they can be done by computers). They are mechanical processes in which each step follows from the last according to a simple set of rules. On the other hand, determining the steps of each algorithm — what exactly needs to be done, and in what order, to solve the problem at hand — requires a great deal of thought and experimentation. So while the <em>execution</em> of the algorithm may be boring and require no intelligence, it is the <em>process of designing</em> algorithms that is interesting, intellectually challenging, and a central part of what we call programming.</p>
<p>Some of the things that people do naturally, without difficulty or conscious thought, are the hardest to express algorithmically. Understanding natural language is a good example. We all do it, but so far no one has been able to explain <em>how</em> we do it, at least not in the form of a step-by-step mechanical algorithm.</p>
<p>Our goal in computer science is to take a problem and develop an algorithm that can serve as a general solution. Once we have such a solution, we can use our computer to automate the execution. As noted above, programming is a skill that allows a computer scientist to take an algorithm and represent it in a program that can be followed by a computer. These programs are written in <strong>programming languages</strong>.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-python-programming-language">
<span id="index-2"></span><h2>The Python Programming Language<a class="headerlink" href="#the-python-programming-language" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The programming language you will be learning is Python. Python is an example of a <strong>high-level language</strong>; other high-level languages you might have heard of are C++, PHP, and Java.</p>
<p>As you might infer from the name “high-level language”, there are also <strong>low-level languages</strong>, sometimes referred to as machine languages or assembly languages. Machine language is the encoding of instructions in binary so that they can be directly executed by the computer. Assembly language uses a slightly easier format to refer to the low level instructions. Loosely speaking, computers can only execute programs written in low-level languages. To be exact, computers can actually only execute programs written in machine language. Thus, programs written in a high-level language (and even those in an assembly language) have to be processed before they can run. This extra processing takes some time, which is a small disadvantage of high-level languages. However, the advantages to high-level languages are enormous.</p>
<p>First, it is much easier to program in a high-level language. Programs written in a high-level language take less time to write, they are shorter and easier to read, and they are more likely to be correct. Second, high-level languages are <strong>portable</strong>, meaning that they can run on different kinds of computers with few or no modifications. Low-level programs can run on only one kind of computer and have to be rewritten to run on another.</p>
<p>Due to these advantages, almost all programs are written in high-level languages. Low-level languages are used only for a few specialized applications.</p>
<p>Two kinds of programs process high-level languages into low-level languages: <strong>interpreters</strong> and <strong>compilers</strong>. An interpreter reads a high-level program and executes it, meaning that it does what the program says. It processes the program a little at a time, alternately reading lines and performing computations.</p>
<img alt="Interpret illustration" src="/Figures/interpret.png"/>
<p>A compiler reads the program and translates it completely before the program starts running. In this case, the high-level program is called the <strong>source code</strong>, and the translated program is called the <strong>object code</strong> or the <strong>executable</strong>. Once a program is compiled, you can execute it repeatedly without further translation.</p>
<img alt="Compile illustration" src="/Figures/compile.png"/>
<p>Many modern languages use both processes. They are first compiled into a low-level language, called <strong>byte code</strong>, and then interpreted by a program called a <strong>virtual machine</strong>. Python uses both processes, but because of the way programmers interact with it, it is usually considered an interpreted language.</p>
<p>There are two ways to use the Python interpreter: <em>shell mode</em> and <em>program mode</em>. In shell mode, you type Python expressions into the <strong>Python shell</strong>, and the interpreter immediately shows the result. The example below shows the Python shell at work.</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ python
Python 3.2 (r32:88445, Mar 25 2011, 19:28:28)
[GCC 4.5.2] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; 2 + 3
5
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span></code> is called the <strong>Python prompt</strong>. The interpreter uses the prompt to indicate that it is ready for instructions. We typed <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">2</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">3</span></code>. The interpreter evaluated our expression and replied <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">5</span></code>. On the next line it gave a new prompt indicating that it is ready for more input.</p>
<p>Working directly in the interpreter is convenient for testing short bits of code because you get immediate feedback. Think of it as scratch paper used to help you work out problems.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can write an entire program by placing lines of Python instructions in a file and then use the interpreter to execute the contents of the file as a whole. Such a file is often referred to as <strong>source code</strong>. For example, we used a text editor to create a source code file named <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">first_program.py</span></code> with the following contents:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"My first program adds two numbers, 2 and 3:"</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>By convention, files that contain Python programs have names that end with <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">.py</span></code>.  Following this convention will help your operating system and other programs identify a file as containing python code.</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ python first_program.py
My first program adds two numbers, 2 and 3:
5
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>These examples show Python being run from a Unix command line. In other development environments, the details of executing programs may differ. Also, most programs are more interesting than this one.</p>

<span id="index-3"></span><h2>Executing Python in this Book<a class="headerlink" href="#executing-python-in-this-book" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This book provides two special ways to execute Python programs. Both techniques are designed to assist you as you learn the Python programming language. They will help you increase your understanding of how Python programs work.</p>
<p>First, you can write, modify, and execute programs using a unique <strong>activecode</strong> interpreter that allows you to execute Python code right in the text itself (right from the web browser). Although this is certainly not the way real programs are written, it provides an excellent environment for learning a programming language like Python since you can experiment with the language as you are reading.</p>
<p>Take a look at the activecode interpreter in action. If we use the Python code from the previous example and make it active, you will see that it can be executed directly by pressing the <em>run</em> button. Try pressing the <em>run</em> button below.</p>
<textarea data-audio="" data-codelens="true" data-component="activecode" data-lang="python" data-timelimit="25000" id="ch01_1">
print("My first program adds two numbers, 2 and 3:")
print(2 + 3)
</textarea>
<p>Now try modifying the activecode program shown above. First, modify the string in the first print statement by changing the word <em>adds</em> to the word <em>multiplies</em>. Now press <em>run</em>. You can see that the result of the program has changed. However, it still prints “5” as the answer. Modify the second print statement by changing the addition symbol, the “+”, to the multiplication symbol, “*”. Press <em>run</em> to see the new results.</p>
<p>In addition to activecode, you can also execute Python code with the assistance of a unique visualization tool. This tool, known as <strong>codelens</strong>, allows you to control the step by step execution of a program. It also lets you see the values of all variables as they are created and modified. The following example shows codelens in action on the same program as we saw above. Note that in activecode, the source code executes from beginning to end and you can see the final result. In codelens you can see and control the step by step progress. Note that the red arrow always points to the next line of code that is going to be executed. The light green arrow points to the line that was just executed.</p>

<p>The examples in this book use a mixture of the standard Python  interpreter, source code, activecode, and codelens. You will be able to tell which is which by looking for either the Python prompt in the case of a shell mode program, the <em>run</em> button for the activecode, or the <em>forward/backward</em> buttons for codelens.</p>

<span id="index-4"></span><h2>More About Programs<a class="headerlink" href="#more-about-programs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A <strong>program</strong> is a sequence of instructions that specifies how to perform a computation. The computation might be something as complex as rendering an html page in a web browser or encoding a video and streaming it across the network. It can also be a symbolic computation, such as searching for and replacing text in a document or (strangely enough) compiling a program.</p>
<p>The details look different in different languages, but a few basic instructions appear in just about every language.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>input</dt>
<dd>Get data from the keyboard, a file, or some other device.</dd>
<dt>output</dt>
<dd>Display data on the screen or send data to a file or other device.</dd>
<dt>math and logic</dt>
<dd>Perform basic mathematical operations like addition and multiplication and logical operations like <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">and</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">or</span></code>, and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">not</span></code>.</dd>
<dt>conditional execution</dt>
<dd>Check for certain conditions and execute the appropriate sequence of statements.</dd>
<dt>repetition</dt>
<dd>Perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Believe it or not, that’s pretty much all there is to it. Every program you’ve ever used, no matter how complicated, is made up of instructions that look more or less like these. Thus, we can describe programming as <em>the process of breaking a large, complex task into smaller and smaller subtasks until the subtasks are simple enough to be performed with sequences of these basic instructions</em>.</p>

<h2>A Typical First Program<a class="headerlink" href="#a-typical-first-program" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Traditionally, the first program written in a new language is called <em>Hello, World!</em> because all it does is display the words, “Hello, World!”. In Python, the source code looks like this.</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Hello, World!"</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This is an example of using the <strong>print function</strong>, which doesn’t actually print anything on paper. It displays a value on the screen. In this case, the result is the phrase:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Hello, World!
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Here is the example in activecode. Give it a try!</p>
<textarea data-audio="" data-codelens="true" data-component="activecode" data-lang="python" data-timelimit="25000" id="ch01_2">
print("Hello, World!")
</textarea>
<p>The quotation marks in the program mark the beginning and end of the value. They don’t appear in the result.</p>
<p>Some people judge the quality of a programming language by the simplicity of the <em>Hello, World!</em> program. By this standard, Python does about as well as possible.</p>

<p>As programs get bigger and more complicated, they get more difficult to read. Formal languages are dense, and it is often difficult to look at a piece of code and figure out what it is doing, or why. For this reason, it is a good idea to add notes to your programs to explain in natural language what the program is doing. These notes are called comments.</p>
<p>A <strong>comment</strong> in a computer program is text that is intended only for the human reader - it is completely ignored by the interpreter. In Python, the <cite>#</cite> token starts a comment. The rest of the line is ignored. Here is a new version of <em>Hello, World!</em>.</p>

<p>Notice that when you run this program, it still only prints the phrase Hello, World! None of the comments appear. You’ll also notice that we’ve left a blank line in the program.

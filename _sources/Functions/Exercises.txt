                Use the ``draw_square`` function we wrote in this chapter to draw the image shown below. Assume each side is 20 units.

                (Hint: notice that the turtle has already moved away from the ending point of the last square when the program ends.)

                The two spirals in this picture differ only by the turn angle. Draw both.

                *Note:* Because this program might receive a ``TimeLimitError`` we've added some code to our answer to make the turtle go faster (use its ``speed`` method) and to increase the time the program is allowed to run to 35 seconds. You can do the latter in your code using:

                .. sourcecode:: python

                    import sys

    Write a function ``area_of_circle(r)`` which returns the area of a circle of radius ``r``

    As a refresher, the area of any circle is equal to the radius squared, multiplied by pi (where pi is 3.14159....).

    Don't forget to include the ``math`` module, where pi is defined.

    .. activecode:: ex_5_8

        # TODO: use def to define a function called area_of_circle which takes an argument called r

            # TODO implement your function to return the area of a circle whose radius is r


        # Below are some tests which can give you an indication that your code seems to be correct.

        from test import testEqual

        t = area_of_circle(0)
        testEqual(t, 0)
        t = area_of_circle(1)
        testEqual(t,math.pi)
        t = area_of_circle(100)
        testEqual(t, 31415.926535897932)
        t = area_of_circle(-1)
        testEqual(t, math.pi)
        t = area_of_circle(-5)
        testEqual(t, 25 * math.pi)

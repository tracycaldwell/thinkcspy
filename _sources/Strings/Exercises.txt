            .. tab:: Question

               Write a function called ``rot13`` that uses the Caesar cipher to encrypt a message. The Caesar cipher works like a substitution cipher but each character is replaced by the character 13 characters to "its right" in the alphabet. So for example the letter "a" becomes the letter "n". If a letter is past the middle of the alphabet then the counting wraps around to the letter "a" again, so "n" becomes "a", "o" becomes "b" and so on.  *Hint:* Whenever you talk about things wrapping around its a good idea to think of modulo arithmetic (using the remainder operator).

Graded Lesson Assignment
========================

.. container:: full_width

    Write a function ``analyze_text`` that receives a string as input. Your function should count the number of alphabetic characters (a through z, or A through Z) in the text and also keep track of how many are the letter ``'e'`` (upper or lowercase).

    Your function should return an analysis of the text in the form of a string phrased exactly like this:

    "The text contains 240 alphabetic characters, of which 105 (43.75%) are 'e'."

    You will need to make use of the ``isalpha`` function, which can be used like this

    .. code-block:: python

        "a".isalpha() # => evaluates to True
        "3".isalpha() # => evaluates to False
        "&".isalpha() # => False
        " ".isalpha() # => False

        mystr = "Q"
        mystr.isalpha() # => True

    .. activecode:: ex_8_3

        def analyze_text(text):
            # Your code here


        # Note that depending on whether you use str.format or string concatenation
        # your code will pass different tests. As long as your code passes either
        # tests 1-3 OR tests 4-6, you'll be okay. See below for more details.
        from test import testEqual

        # Tests 1-3: solutions using string concatenation should pass these
        text1 = "Eeeee"
        answer1 = "The text contains 5 alphabetic characters, of which 5 (100.0%) are 'e'."
        testEqual(analyze_text(text1), answer1)

        text2 = "Blueberries are tasteee!"
        answer2 = "The text contains 21 alphabetic characters, of which 7 (33.3333333333%) are 'e'."
        testEqual(analyze_text(text2), answer2)

        text3 = "Wright's book, Gadsby, contains a total of 0 of that most common symbol ;)"
        answer3 = "The text contains 55 alphabetic characters, of which 0 (0.0%) are 'e'."
        testEqual(analyze_text(text3), answer3)

        # Tests 4-6: solutions using str.format should pass these
        text4 = "Eeeee"
        answer4 = "The text contains 5 alphabetic characters, of which 5 (100%) are 'e'."
        testEqual(analyze_text(text4), answer4)

        text5 = "Blueberries are tasteee!"
        answer5 = "The text contains 21 alphabetic characters, of which 7 (33.33333333333333%) are 'e'."
        testEqual(analyze_text(text5), answer5)

        text6 = "Wright's book, Gadsby, contains a total of 0 of that most common symbol ;)"
        answer6 = "The text contains 55 alphabetic characters, of which 0 (0%) are 'e'."
        testEqual(analyze_text(text6), answer6)

           .. tab:: Question

                A drunk pirate makes a random turn and then takes 100 steps forward, makes another random turn, takes another 100 steps, turns another random amount, etc. A social science student records the angle of each turn before the next 100 steps are taken. Her experimental data is ``160, -43, 270, -97, -43, 200, -940, 17, -86``. (Positive angles are counter-clockwise.)  Use a turtle to draw the path taken by our drunk friend.

        12
        10
        ...etc


    b. Write a second loop that prints each number and its square on a new line, precisely like this: ::

        The square of 12 is 144
        The square of 10 is 100
        ...etc

    .. activecode:: ex_3_4

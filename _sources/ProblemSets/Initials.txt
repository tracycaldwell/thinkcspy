Initials
---------

The main goal of this assignment is to remove you from the comfortable sandbox of the Active Code editors in this online book, and introduce you to the tools you need to start writing Python code locally on your own computer. By the end of the assignment, you will have written a small text-based program that tells the user the initials of his or her name.

The assignment is broken into 2 parts:

1. `Using Python Locally`_
    In part 1, we will guide you through all the setup work necessary for writing and executing Python code on your machine:

    - Learn how to use the *command line* interface on your computer
    - Install a text editor
    - Install Python
    - Use your text editor to write Python code in a ``.py`` file
    - Execute your Python file on the command line.

2. `Initials`_
    In part 2, you will get down to business creating the program described above. This will be just like one of the typical Exercises at the end of the chapters in this book. The only difference is that you will be writing your code in a text editor and saving it locally on your computer.


Part 1: Using Python Locally
============================

In this section, you will learn how to interact with your computer using the command line, and then you will install everything you need to start writing and running code. Pick the operating system you use to go to the associated setup instructions page:

:ref:`Windows_Setup`

:ref:`Mac_Setup`

:ref:`Linux_Setup`

.. note::
    If you have already completed our **Unit 0: Coding Prep**, then you have already practiced working on the command line. In this case, it is up to you to decide whether you'd like to do the command line practice suggested in these sections for review, or -- if you feel you're proficient on the command line -- to skip it.

Part 2: Initials
=================

Now that you have a little practice using the command-line, and have installed Python and a text editor, it is time to create your program.

Setup
~~~~~

First, you must create a new folder for the project, and a new file within the folder. And while we're here, let's make sure you set up your overall directory structure in a nice, organized way for future assignments.

Open up a terminal (command line) window on your computer. After completing the Python setup above, you should already have a folder named ``lc101/`` in your home directory, where you will save all your assignments for this class.

But if you do *not* yet have such a class parent folder on your file system, then create one now:

::

    $ mkdir lc101

.. note::
    Remember that in the example above, you should not actually type the dollar sign ``$``. We use that symbol just as a convention to indicate that the example takes place at the command-line prompt in a terminal window.

Next, use the ``cd`` command to navigate so that you are inside that parent folder:

::

    $ cd lc101

Once you are inside your directory for the class, create a new sub-directory for this assignment called ``initials/``, and then ``cd`` into it:

::

    $ mkdir initials
    $ cd initials

In general, for the remainder of LC 101, you should follow this same pattern for every new assignment:

1. Navigate into the parent folder (e.g. ``lc101/``).
2. Create a new subfolder for the new assignment.
3. Change directories into that new subfolder.
4. Start coding!

For example, if you are starting an assignment called *Hungry Hungry Hippos*, then you should do this:

::

    $ cd lc101
    $ mkdir hungry-hungry-hippos
    $ cd hungry-hungry-hippos

And your overall directory structure will look like this:

::

    lc101/
        |
        +------ using-python-locally/
        |           |
        |           +----- hello.py
        |
        +------ initials/
        |           |
        |           +----- # initials stuff
        |
        +------ hungry-hungry-hippos/
        |           |
        |           +----- # hippo stuff
        ... etc

The Initials Program
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now you are finally ready to start coding! Inside your ``initials/`` folder, create a new file called ``initials.py``:

::

    $ touch initials.py

Open up that file in your text editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code), and copy and paste in the following starter code:

.. sourcecode:: python

    def get_initials(fullname):
        """ Given a person's name, returns the person's initials (uppercase) """
        # TODO your code here

Your function will receive one argument -- ``fullname``, a string representing someone's name -- and should return a string with that name's capitalized initials.

Here are some examples of what your function should return for various ``fullname`` arguments:

+------------------+-----------------+
| ``fullname``     | return value    |
+==================+=================+
| Ozzie Smith      | OS              |
+------------------+-----------------+
| Bonnie blair     | BB              |
+------------------+-----------------+
| George           | G               |
+------------------+-----------------+
| Daniel Day Lewis | DDL             |
+------------------+-----------------+

.. note::
    Even if the name starts with a lowercase letter, you should always capitalize the initials. For example, notice how even if ``fullname == "Bonnie blair"``, you should still return ``"BB"`` rather than ``"Bb"``

.. note::
    You may assume that the name will contain only letters (uppercase and/or lowercase) plus single spaces between words. This means you don’t have to worry about Conan O’Brien, T.S. Eliot, or Cee-Lo Green.

If you were to invoke your function and print the result, it would look something like this:

.. sourcecode:: python

    ozzie_inits = get_initials("Ozzie Smith")
    print("The initials of 'Ozzie Smith' are", ozzie_inits)
    # => prints "The initials of 'Ozzie Smith' are OS"

Okay, enough chit-chat. Go forth and code!

.. hint::
    You'll need to collect the initials as you find them, and return them all together at the end. You may want to re-read about `The Accumulator Pattern`_.

Testing
~~~~~~~

When (you think) you are finished writing your ``get_initials`` function, you should test it to make sure it works. There are a few ways to do this:

1. You can import your script into a REPL (Python shell), and then feed various inputs into your function.
2. Alternatively, you can just add some print statements (like the "Ozzie Smith" example above) to your ``initials.py`` script, and check to see that various inputs produce the correct results.

Technique 1 looks like this:

::

    $ python
    Python 3.6.0 |Continuum Analytics, Inc.| (default, Dec 23 2016, 13:19:00)
    [GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 6.0 (clang-600.0.57)] on darwin
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> from initials import get_initials
    >>> get_initials("Ozzie Smith")
    OS
    >>> get_initials("bonnie blair")
    BB
    >>> get_initials("Daniel Day Lewis")
    DDL
    ... etc
    quit()

.. note::
    You must run ``python`` from your `lc101/initials` directory for the ``import`` command to work.

That looks complicated but its actually very easy. Try typing ``python`` into your terminal and you'll see. Technique 1 is definitely recommended, because writing and changing bunch of print statements starts to get annoying very quickly.

But if you prefer Technique 2, here's how that works: Simply add print statements to your file, and then run your script on the command-line:

::

    $ python caesar.py
    The initials of 'Ozzie Smith' are OS
    The initials of 'bonnie blair' are BB
    The initials of 'Daniel Day Lewis' are DDL
    ... etc

After running your script, just test by hand that the output matches what you expected to see.

Either way, whether using the REPL or print statements, make sure to test your function against a healthy variety of inputs.

Make It Interactive
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let's now turn this into an interactive program that a user can run from the terminal. All you have to do is add an ``input`` statement to ask the user for his/her name, and then a ``print`` statement to report the results back to him/her. Your program should work like this:

::

    $ python initials.py
    What is your full name?
    Ozzie Smith
    OS

Just to be clear about the example above:

- The user typed the first line, causing the program to run.
- Then, the program printed the second line asking for their name.
- Then the user typed the third line ("Ozzie Smith").
- Finally, the program printed the initials ("OS").

Make it Importable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Almost done! There is one more thing you must do before submitting. Presumably, your file now looks like this:

.. sourcecode:: python

    def get_initials(fullname):
        # some code here

    # some more code here (input and print statements)

As you know, the second block of code contains the lines that actually get executed when the user runs the script. The code *inside* the ``get_initials`` function, by contrast, only executes thanks to the fact that it *gets invoked* by one of the statements from that second block of code that sits all the way on the left, at the global level of scope.

Generally speaking, however, it is actually bad practice to have "loose" statements floating around at that left-most, unindented scope of a script. There are two reasons why:

**Issue 1: Organization.** As your script grows larger, it can become hard to keep track of all those loose statements, especially if you don't keep them all together in one block. At that point, you will start to loose track of exactly what happens when the script is run.

**Issue 2: Importing.** When some other file tries to ``import`` this file, all the loose statements will be executed, which is probably not what the other file wanted. For example, say you are writing another script, and you once again encounter the need to parse initials from people's names. Instead of re-writing the ``get_initials`` function, this is a perfect chance to reuse the code you have already written by importing your ``initials.py`` file. Sounds great! But unfortunately, the moment you import the file, those ``input`` and ``print`` statements will blurt out and start talking to the user.

The solution to Issue 1 is to move your ``input`` and ``print`` statements into a ``main`` function, like this:

.. sourcecode:: python

    def get_initials(fullname):
        # some code here

    def main():
        # some more code here (input and print statements)

    main()

In the new version, notice that we have placed the second block of code inside a function called ``main``. This is the generally accepted pattern: Move all loose statements into a ``main`` function so that you have them together in one place. Finally, the *only* loose statement left is the invocation of ``main`` at the end.

Issue 2 can be solved by adding one more line of code that places the ``main()`` invocation inside a (strange-looking) ``if`` statement:

.. sourcecode:: python

    def get_initials(fullname):
        # some code here

    def main():
        # some more code here (input and print statements)

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        main()

In effect, that conditional says:

    "If this is actually the main program that is being run, then go ahead and execute the ``main`` function. Otherwise, if this file is being imported, or something else is going on, then stay quiet and do nothing."

.. note::
    If you are curious about the ``if __name__ == '__main__':`` conditional, you can check out this `Stack Overflow post`_.

Now we are good to go! The program works normally when run directly from the command-line, but if some other file imports it, the ``main`` function will not execute. All of this should be a review, since we have been using this structure throughout the book after learning about ``__main__`` in the Functions chapter.

    counter
        A variable used to count something, usually initialized to zero and incremented in the body of a loop.

    cursor
        An invisible marker that keeps track of where the next character will be printed.

    definite iteration
        A loop where we have an upper bound on the number of times the body will be executed. Definite iteration is usually best coded as a ``for`` loop.

    escape sequence
        An escape character, ``\``, followed by one or more printable characters used to designate a non-printable character.

    infinite loop
        A loop in which the terminating condition is never satisfied.

    indefinite iteration
        A loop we need to keep repeating until some condition is met. A ``while`` statement is used for this case.

    nested loop
        A loop inside the body of another loop.

    newline
        A special character that causes the cursor to move to the beginning of
        the next line.

    tab
        A special character that causes the cursor to move to the next tab stop
        on the current line.

Save Your Spot in Coding 101
============================

Thanks for your interest in the free coding 101 course. This is a class for BEGINNERS. If you know nothing at all about programming you're right on track!

Due to high demand, we require prospective students to complete a short quiz in order to reserve a potential spot in the class. The quiz is NOT being graded, but it will be used to gauge a student's interest in the course.

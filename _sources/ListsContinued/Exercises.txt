    #.  Create a list containing 100 random integers between 0 and 1000 (use iteration, ``append``, and the ``random`` module). Write a function called ``average`` that will take the list as a parameter and return the average.

            .. tab:: Question

               Write a Python function that will take a list of 100 random integers between 0 and 1000 (you can use iteration, ``append``, and the ``random`` module to create a test list) and return the maximum value. (Note: there is a built-in function named ``max`` but do not use it for this exercise.)

    #. Write a function ``sum_of_squares(xs)`` that computes the sum
       of the squares of the numbers in the list ``xs``.  For example,
       ``sum_of_squares([2, 3, 4])`` should return 4+9+16 which is ``29``:

            .. tab:: Question

               Although Python provides us with many list methods, it is good practice and very instructive to think about how they are implemented. Implement your own Python functions that works like the following built-in ones:

               a. count
               #. in
               #. reverse
               #. index
               #. insert

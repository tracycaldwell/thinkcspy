Donuts

*Studios are in-class activities to give you hands-on practice with new concepts. The first half is the Walkthrough, an instructor-led programming problem. The second half is for you to work on individually or in pairs in class.*

*These problems are not graded, and you are not obligated to finish them. Get as far as you can while in class, and use them as an opportunity to play with and solidify new concepts.*

Walkthrough

Imagine you're an American tourist in London. You're *very* hungry, but can't figure out how many orders of fish-and-chips you can afford. They cost £4.79 (4 pounds, 79 pence) for one order, but the conversion rates are confusing! Let's write a program that asks

- The current dollar-to-pound exchange rate (eg, $1.00 is £0.76 right now when I'm writing this)
- How many dollars you're willing to spend.

and tells us how many orders of fish-and-chips we can afford.

.. activecode:: donuts_walkthrough

    # prompt for dollar to pound exchange
    pounds_per_dollar = input("Current dollar-to-pound exchange rate: ")
    pounds_per_dollar = float(pounds_per_dollar)

    # prompt for our budget in dollars
    budget_in_dollars = input("How much are you willing to spend (dollars)? ")
    budget_in_dollars = int(num_flags)

    # give a name to our fixed value (cost of fish-and-chips)
    pounds_per_fish_and_chips_order = 4.79

    # calculate how much money we have in pounds
    budget_in_pounds = budget_in_dollars * pounds_per_dollar

    # calculate how many orders I can buy with that amount of money
    # (notice we're using '//' to be sure we get a whole number.
    #  if you're not sure what this does, change it to '/')
    num_fish = budget_in_pounds // pounds_per_fish_and_chips_order

    # print out number of orders
    print("You can afford", num_fish, "orders of fish-and-chips!")

Studio

Here's the scenario:

You run a hip new artisanal donut shop, the Loop Hole, which, in its short lifetime, has already rocked the boutique-desserts market with numerous "disruptions", including:

* a minimalist menu consisting of just one type of donut per day: Manager's Special... always Manager's Special.
* giving customers the option to order fractional amounts of donuts, e.g. 1.7 donuts, please.
* a progressive pay-what-you-want pricing system, in which the customer pays what s/he thinks is a fair price. (Of course, you do provide a "suggested price".)

Now it's time to implement your latest innovation, an app via which users can pre-order donuts remotely from the convenience of... the command-line terminal on their computer.

In the editor below, write a program which introduces the flavor of the day, and then takes the user's order.

Taking their order involves asking two questions:

1. How many donuts do they want to buy?
2. How much do you want to pay per donut?

After getting input, you should:

3. Inform the user of the total cost of their order.
4. Don't forget to include sales-tax, which is, let's say, 5%.

Here's an example of how the finished program should behave. Note that lines starting with ``>>>`` represent user input.

    Welcome to the Loop Hole!
    Today's Manager's Special is:
    Crunch Jelly: A traditional jelly donut in which the jelly filling is made entirely of Capn' Crunch Oops! All Berries
    How many would you like?
    >>> 3.33333
    How much would you like to pay per donut (suggested price is $4.35 each)?
    >>> 2.5
    Ok, let me prepare that for you....
    After tax, your total is: $8.74999125
    Thank you for snacking! Loop back around here soon!

Notice that the total price ``$8.74999125`` went way beyond 2 decimal places. Obviously it would be a little nicer to round that to $8.75. We haven't learned this yet, but you'll be able to do this later. Don't worry about it now.

(Also, don't be concerned if your program gives an answer with a slightly different number of decimal places than the example program above. This is just a precision issue.)

For the Manager's Special, you can make something up (you are the Manager, after all), or just use the Crunch Berries example. Whatever you decide, you can simply hard-code it directly into your code. In other words, the flavor doesn't actually have to change depending on what day it is. The important part of this Studio is the process involved in calculating the cost of the user's order.

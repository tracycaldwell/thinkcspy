Hello World
===========

*Studios are in-class activities to give you hands-on practice with new concepts. The first half is the Walkthrough, an instructor-led programming problem. The second half is for you to work on individually or in pairs in class.*

*These problems are not graded, and you are not obligated to finish them. Get as far as you can while in class, and use them as an opportunity to play with and solidify new concepts.*

Walkthrough
-----------

Our first walkthrough ever is a Computer Science tradition. The first program many students write is one that prints "Hello World" to the console, as if the computer were greeting us.

We'll use it as an opportunity to try out the activecode feature in our browser.

.. activecode:: hello_world

    print('Hello World!')


Studio
------

Change the code so that the computer greets you in particular ("Hello, Brian"), or to something else you imagine a robot coming alive might say.

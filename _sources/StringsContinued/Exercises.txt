    #. In Robert McCloskey's book *Make Way for Ducklings*, the names of the ducklings are Jack, Kack, Lack, Mack, Nack, Ouack, Pack, and Quack. This loop tries to output these names in order.

       .. sourcecode:: python

          prefixes = "JKLMNOPQ"
          suffix = "ack"

        	for p in prefixes:
        	    print(p + suffix)


       Of course, that's not quite right because Ouack and Quack are misspelled.
       Can you fix it?

    #. Write a function that implements a substitution cipher. In a substitution cipher one letter is substituted for another to garble the message. For example A -> Q, B -> T, C -> G etc. your function should take two parameters, the message you want to encrypt, and a string that represents the mapping of the 26 letters in the alphabet. Your function should return a string that is the encrypted version of the message.

               Write a function that decrypts the message from the previous exercise. It
               should also take two parameters. The encrypted message,
               and the mixed up alphabet. The function should return a string that is
               the same as the original unencrypted message.

            .. tab:: Question

               Write a function called ``rot13`` that uses the Caesar cipher to encrypt a message. The Caesar cipher works like a substitution cipher but each character is replaced by the character 13 characters to "its right" in the alphabet. So for example the letter "a" becomes the letter "n". If a letter is past the middle of the alphabet then the counting wraps around to the letter "a" again, so "n" becomes "a", "o" becomes "b" and so on.  *Hint:* Whenever you talk about things wrapping around its a good idea to think of modulo arithmetic (using the remainder operator).

Graded Lesson Assignment
========================

.. container:: full_width

    Write a function that mirrors its argument. For example, ``mirror('good')`` should return a string holding the value ``gooddoog``. (Hint: Make use of the ``reverse`` function that you wrote in a previous exercise).

    .. activecode:: ex_8_6

        def mirror(text):
            # your code here


        def reverse(text):
            # your code here


        # some tests to check your work. You shouldn't modify these.
        from test import testEqual
        testEqual(mirror('good'), 'gooddoog')
        testEqual(mirror('Python'), 'PythonnohtyP')
        testEqual(mirror(''), '')
        testEqual(mirror('a'), 'aa')
